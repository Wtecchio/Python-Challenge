# Python-Challenge
This project was a demonstration of the capabilities of python parcing multiple different large data sets.

**concepts utilized on the project:** <br />
accessing csv files and exctracting data  <br />
data manipulation techniques with the use of dictionaries and lists in Python <br />
creating .csv files through .py scripts 
creating multiple functions to aid in parcing through data<br />
<br />

First conclusion of settuping up the code:
  This project gave me a new-found confidence in being able to parce through larger data sets, being able to pull meaningful data that vbs couldn't reproduce. 
  albeit not the most efficent code, but it was a first start at being able to efficently see patterns in projects such as these.
  
  looking-forward to the next challenges.
